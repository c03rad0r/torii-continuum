# Continuum

An app builder, project engine and marketplace for bot work — a gateway into the Torii ecosystem.

Continuum treats every project like a nostr identity: portable, signable, yours. Projects, sessions, milestones, todos, and files are all shaped as nostr events (addressable kinds 30078–30082). MVP stores them in `localStorage`; the same objects flip to signed relay events without re-shaping.

## What's here (v0.2.0-alpha)

**Frontend (`src/`)**

- **Landing page** at `#/` — marketing surface with the sovereignty story, torii-arch hero, promises grid, freedom-tech pillars, live status roadmap. Click through to the demo, or Login with Nostr.
- **Projects** — list, create, open. Import from GitHub or ngit. Cascades to sessions/milestones/todos/files.
- **Project home** — milestones ladder, session log, live todo list, files created.
- **Marketplace** — open AI-work tasks. Yours highlighted amber.
- **Routstr** — real Cashu wallet top-up when an agent is configured; mock behaviour on demo builds. Default coding model: DeepSeek-Coder-V2. Default chat model: DeepSeek Chat.
- **Dashboard** — cross-project oversight rundown.
- **AI chat dock** — routes through your agent (POST /api/chat) when signed in; falls back to mock replies otherwise.
- **NIP-07 login** — sidebar button opens a Plebeian Signer flow, signs a kind 22242 challenge, and stores the returned session token locally.

**Agent (`agent/`, Node 20 + Fastify)**

A small daemon designed for one operator, one VPS, one npub. Owns:

- NIP-07 login verification (no nsec ever touches the VPS)
- Cashu wallet float on disk (`memory/wallet/`, mode 0600)
- Routstr chat calls (OpenAI-compat, DeepSeek-Chat by default, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 for coding, configurable fallback ladder, one Cashu token per request)

See `agent/README.md` for the VPS bring-up runbook and `agent/PRIVACY.md` for the invariants.
