# Torii Continuum — Strategy & Next Steps

Living document. This will change as we learn.

Source-of-truth split: this file (`strategy.md`) owns Continuum's vision, core principles, decision rules, and architecture direction. `continuum-todo.md` owns the active task queue. `HANDOVER.md` and `README.md` are the developer entry points.

Continuum is a **separate app** from Torii Quest. Quest is the game; Continuum is the sovereign dashboard, project engine, and personal AI layer. They share a Space Brain (Perplexity Space `Torii`) and a namespace (`torii-*`), but they are two repos, two versioning cadences, two live surfaces:

- Continuum live: `https://continuum-torii.pplx.app`
- Quest live: `https://torii-quest.pplx.app`

## What We Are Building

Torii Continuum is a sovereign, Nostr-native personal AI and project engine. It exists to give the Chiefmonkey / Plebeian / Torii ecosystem a **single privacy-first surface** for:

- Reading and writing the Space Brain (the curated knowledge wiki used by all Torii projects).
- Editing project todo files and strategy docs through safe assistant-editable pipelines.
- Drafting Nostr events (chat, project cards, todos, marketplace tasks) as encrypted envelopes for the user to approve and sign.
- Coordinating between Torii apps (Quest, Plebeian.Market integrations, Nostr Arena archive) without acting as a central operator.
- Eventually — through the Continuum agent roadmap (CONT-AGENT-1..N) — becoming a self-hostable "always-on second brain" that runs on a VPS with no key material, drafts everything, publishes nothing without a browser click.

Continuum is not a game. It is not a shooter, a world builder, or a chat client. It is the **oversight, memory, and coordination layer** that makes the rest of the ecosystem sovereign in practice, not just in theory.

## Vision

Long-term, Continuum is the piece that makes "self-sovereign AI + self-sovereign identity + self-sovereign value" a real daily-driver experience rather than three separate demos.

- **Personal AI without a platform.** No cloud vendor holds the memory. No SaaS holds the account. The agent runs where the user runs it (VPS, later Linux/Mac clients), signs nothing on its own, and treats every publish as human-approved.
- **Project engine on Nostr.** Projects (kind-30078), todos (kind-30081), and later marketplace tasks (kind-30090) become first-class citizens the agent can read, draft, and — with explicit user approval — write.
- **Privacy-first by construction.** All Nostr writes are gift-wrapped (NIP-17) by default. The plaintext code path is absent, not disabled. Local storage stays under `chmod 700`. Prompt bodies do not appear in logs.
- **Bitcoin-native model layer.** Model inference is paid per-request in Cashu via Routstr — no API-key custody, no monthly SaaS bill, no lock-in to a single provider.
- **The gateway to Torii.** Continuum is the piece that gives Quest, Plebeian.Market, and future Torii apps a shared memory, a shared agent, and a shared privacy posture.

Where Quest is the playful spatial front end, Continuum is the quiet infrastructure that makes the whole stack usable long-term.

## Core Principles

- **Privacy first.** Nostr-native does not mean publish-everything. Anything that ever gets posted to Nostr must be gift-wrapped in cryptography (NIP-17 by default). Local-first, encrypted-first.
- **Sovereignty first.** No nsec on the VPS, ever. Signing lives in the browser through a NIP-07 signer (Plebeian Signer). No custodial fallback.
- **Human in the loop by construction.** The agent drafts. The human approves. The browser signs. No autonomous publish path in v1.
- **Read-only until proven.** Every Continuum feature starts read-only or mockup-only. Live actions require an explicit slice, explicit gates, and explicit approval.
- **Local-first, encrypted-first.** Filesystem posture is `chmod 700`, dedicated OS user, no plaintext prompts in production logs.
- **No vendor lock-in.** Providers (Routstr endpoints, relays, mints) are pinned in config and swappable without rewrites. Every dependency has a documented fallback plan even if the fallback ships later.
- **Incremental, no big rewrites.** Same discipline as Quest. Every slice leaves the system cleaner, smaller, or better-indexed than it found it.
- **Trade-offs over fake certainty.** Every architectural choice is documented with its cost, not just its benefit.
- **Brain-aware.** Continuum reads and (in scoped ways) writes the Space Brain wiki. The Brain is a first-class runtime dependency, not decoration.

## Freedom-Tech Stack (Continuum's slice)

Continuum plugs into the broader freedom-tech stack the ecosystem is being built on:

- **Identity**: npub (Nostr public key). Signing via Plebeian Signer NIP-07 browser extension in v1; NIP-46 remote-signer support deferred to a later slice once Plebeian Signer ships it.
- **Value**: Bitcoin and Cashu. Model inference is paid per-request through Routstr; the VPS holds a small Cashu float (~5k sats) refilled from Plebeian Signer's built-in wallet.
- **Messaging**: Nostr gift-wrapped DMs (NIP-17) for agent-to-user drafts. Self-DM pattern for private-by-default project data.
- **Runtime**: VPS in v1 (single sovereign box). Linux and Mac clients arrive later as thin frontends over the same daemon.
- **Coordination (deferred)**: NIP-34 (`ngit`) will mirror both repos to Nostr and give code coordination — issues, patches, discovery — a Nostr-native path alongside GitHub. **Deferred until Continuum has a working proof of concept.** No mirror push, no repository announcement, no `kind:30617` event until after CONT-AGENT-1 lands and Continuum is worth announcing.

## Continuum Agent Roadmap (CONT-AGENT-1..N)

CONT-AGENT-1 is the current active slice. Later slices are named and reserved to keep scope honest.

### CONT-AGENT-1 — v1 skeleton (active)

Turn Continuum from a read-only mockup dashboard into a sovereign personal AI + project engine.

- **VPS-only.** Linux and Mac clients come later as thin frontends. No iMac dependency in v1.
- **No key material on the VPS.** Signing lives in the browser via Plebeian Signer (NIP-07).
- **No plaintext Nostr write path.** The `nostr.draft` skill only emits NIP-17 gift-wrapped envelopes. The plaintext code path is absent, not disabled.
- **Model layer = Routstr.** OpenAI-compatible client paying per-request in Cashu against pinned providers. Per-skill model pinning; fallback ladder present but off by default.
- **Human-in-the-loop by construction.** Agent drafts to `agent/pending/*.json`; Continuum Console renders them; user clicks Approve; Plebeian Signer signs; browser publishes.
- **Four skills, only these:**
  - `brain.read` — read-only under `projects/torii-*/knowledge/`, `memory/knowledge/`, `memory/notes/`.
  - `brain.write` — write only under `learnings/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (new) and `changelog.md` (append).
  - `todo.patch` — wraps existing `tools/mdPatch.mjs` (Quest repo). Permitted files + capability map inherited from mdPatch-2.
  - `nostr.draft` — builds NIP-17 gift-wrapped envelopes only (inner kinds 14 / 30078 / 30081); writes to `agent/pending/`; never signs, never publishes.
- **Explicitly not in v1**: autonomous signing / publishing, NIP-46 bunker, local Ollama fallback, Quest NPC bridge, dev-help watcher, marketplace worker, embedding-based retrieval, own relay, own Cashu mint.

Full scope, success criteria, and non-goals live in `continuum-todo.md` under CONT-AGENT-1 and in the Space Brain at `projects/self-learning-continuum.md`.

### CONT-CHARACTER-1 — character + memory infrastructure (active)

Adds a **sealed, local-first character stack** so the agent has a stable identity, values, and skills between sessions — without ever leaking to Nostr by default.

**Nostr event kinds (all NIP-44 v2 encrypted to operator's own npub; local-only unless explicit opt-in):**
- `kind:30092` — `character_root` — the operator-signed root of the character tree. One per operator. `d`-tag = `"root"`.
- `kind:30094` — `semantic_fact` — a single durable belief, preference, or fact. `d`-tag = stable slug (e.g. `pseudonym-only`, `ancap-agorist-stance`).
- `kind:30095` — `procedural_skill` — a reflex or reusable how-to that runs before the model speaks. `d`-tag = skill slug (e.g. `refusal-with-law`, `right-speech-filter`).
- `kind:30096` — `destructive_intent` — a *proposal* to wipe/rewrite memory. Requires cooldown + double-signature to enact.
- `kind:30097` — `emergency_wipe_authority` — the **panic key** (**OPTIONAL**, default off in config). Single event, published once and stored offline (password manager acceptable; hardware signer better); its presence in the memory cache collapses the 30096 double-sig requirement to single-sig so the operator can wipe under duress. Without one, wipes still work via the normal double-signature flow.

**Layers loaded at inference time** (from decrypted files in RAM, never disk plaintext):
1. **Character** — CHARACTER.md v2, the Three Laws, sovereignty/privacy stance, 13 reflexes.
2. **Semantic** — facts and preferences ("pseudonym-only", "proud maximalist", "communism was never a candidate").
3. **Procedural** — reflexes that run before the model speaks (right-speech filter, refusal-with-law, harae, disposability-confirm).
4. **Episodic (read-only at reflect time only)** — the agent *never* reads its own past chat log during a live turn. It only reads it during offline reflection to propose new semantic/procedural drafts into `agent/pending/`.

**Signing model:** the agent **never signs on its own**. All 30092/30094/30095/30096/30097 events are drafted as unsigned JSON in `agent/pending/*.draft.json` and signed via Plebeian Signer with an explicit human click.

**Storage default:** encrypted at rest (`<eventid>.enc`), NIP-44 v2 to `admin_npub`. Plaintext lives in tmpfs / RAM only. Never published unless the operator flips an explicit per-event `publish: true` at sign time.

**Files added this slice:**
- `agent/lib/crypto.mjs` — NIP-44 v2 wrap/unwrap via signer round-trip
- `agent/lib/events.mjs` — draft (never sign) helpers for 30092/30094/30095/30096/30097
- `agent/lib/memory.mjs` — decrypting loader (character + semantic + procedural, RAM only)
- `agent/lib/reflect.mjs` — offline pass that reads episodic and drops drafts into `pending/`
- `agent/PANIC_KEY_SETUP.md` — runbook for generating and cold-storing the 30097 event
- Seed drafts under `agent/memory/semantic/*.draft.json` and `agent/skills/*.draft.json`

**Endpoints added:** `/api/character`, `/api/memory`, `/api/reflect` (all admin-gated).

### Later slices (reserved, not scheduled)

- **CONT-AGENT-2** — Nostr write path via NIP-46 remote signer, once Plebeian Signer or an alternative ships it. Enables the agent to publish without a browser click for pre-approved skill outputs.
- **CONT-AGENT-3** — Quest NPC bridge (`quest.npc.talk`). Lets Continuum drive an in-game NPC in Quest.
- **CONT-AGENT-4** — Dev-help watcher. Watches for questions in specific channels/relays and drafts helpful replies for approval.
- **CONT-AGENT-5** — Marketplace worker skill (kind-30090). Drafts, tracks, and reconciles Plebeian.Market marketplace tasks.
- **CONT-AGENT-6** — Self-hosted relay and own Cashu mint, so no third-party rails sit in the critical path.
- **CONT-AGENT-7** — Embedding-based retrieval for the Brain and session history.

### Queued alongside the agent slices

- **NGIT-1 (deferred)** — Mirror `torii-continuum` to Nostr via NIP-34 (`ngit`). Publishes a `kind:30617` repository announcement + state (`kind:30618`) so the repo is cloneable and coordinatable from any NIP-34 client (`gitworkshop.dev`, `n34`, `gitplaza`, `kanbanstr.com`). Deferred until Continuum has a working proof of concept — no announcements until there is something worth announcing. Runbook to be written as `NGIT.md` when the slice is scheduled. Reference: Space Brain — `entities/gitworkshop-and-ngit.md`, `concepts/nip-34-git.md`.

## What Is Shipping vs Mocked

**Live today (mockup / read-only):**
- Continuum Console page at `https://continuum-torii.pplx.app` — read-only dashboard mockup demonstrating the MVP loop (NAP zone status, gateway state, leaderboard preview, Plebeian product panel, GitHub update check).
- `mdPatch-2` pipeline shared with Quest — `continuum-todo.md` in the whitelist, safe assistant-editable notes / appends / replaces.

**Building next (CONT-AGENT-1):**
- VPS agent skeleton under `agent/` in this repo.
- Four scoped skills (`brain.read`, `brain.write`, `todo.patch`, `nostr.draft`).
- Continuum Console wired to the agent HTTPS endpoint with a live "pending drafts" panel.
- Cost log at `agent/memory/costs.jsonl`.
- `agent/README.md` and `agent/PRIVACY.md`.

**Not building yet (explicit):**
- Anything that signs, publishes, or holds an nsec on the VPS.
- Any plaintext Nostr write path.
- Any autonomous action without a browser click.
- NGIT-1 / NIP-34 announcements — deferred until after PoC.

## Decision Rules

- If a slice needs an nsec on the VPS, it is not v1. Redesign until it does not.
- If a slice adds a plaintext Nostr write path, it is not v1. Redesign or delete the code path.
- If a slice adds an autonomous publish path (no browser click), it is not v1 and it is not v2. It waits until NIP-46 support lands and gets its own slice.
- If a skill wants to write outside its whitelist, refuse. Whitelist over allow-list-plus-exceptions.
- If a provider (model, relay, mint) is being pinned, document the fallback in the same commit even if the fallback ships later.
- If a feature can start read-only or mockup-only, it starts that way. Live actions require an explicit slice.
- If Continuum work and Quest work start bleeding into each other, stop and route the task to the correct repo. The two apps stay separate on purpose.

## Open Questions

- **NIP-46 timing.** Plebeian Signer does not yet expose NIP-46. Continuum's autonomous-publish story stays deferred until it does (or until a bunker on a separate device becomes a credible fallback).
- **Cashu float sizing.** ~5k sats is a starting estimate. Real usage data from CONT-AGENT-1's cost log will drive the refill cadence.
- **Routstr provider set.** Which providers to pin per skill is an empirical question. First pass: cheap fast model for skill work, small conversational model for chat. Revisit after two weeks of real usage.
- **Console auth.** The Continuum Console currently ships as an unauthenticated read-only mockup. Once it wires to the agent HTTPS endpoint, npub-based auth becomes required. Model TBD in the CONT-AGENT-1 slice.
- **Repo boundary durability.** Some shared tooling (`tools/mdPatch.mjs`) lives in the Quest repo but serves both apps. If that pattern spreads, spin out a `torii-shared` repo. Not yet.

## Working Recommendation

Ship CONT-AGENT-1 as the next real slice. Keep everything else — NGIT-1, NIP-46 autonomous signing, Quest NPC bridge — parked in the roadmap and out of the active queue. Announce nothing on Nostr until Continuum has something worth announcing.
