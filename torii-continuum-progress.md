# Torii Continuum — Progress log

Living release log for the `torii-continuum` repo. Newest first. One entry per release. Longer slice reports live alongside as `torii-continuum-v0.2.N-<slice>-report.md` when a release warrants deeper narration; this file is the fast scan.

Companion source-of-truth files (per the `Torii` Space instructions, one set per project):

- `torii-continuum-strategy.md` — vision, principles, decision rules, architecture direction.
- `torii-continuum-todo.md` — active task queue.
- `torii-continuum-progress.md` — this file, release log.
- `torii-continuum-handoff.md` — developer entry point / resume point.

## v0.2.12-alpha — finish Space-scoped file naming migration

Rename the last two docs to match the Space convention.

- `strategy.md` → `torii-continuum-strategy.md`.
- `continuum-todo.md` → `torii-continuum-todo.md`.
- New: `torii-continuum-progress.md` (this file).
- Updated in-file cross-references in strategy, todo, handoff, and any code that mentioned the old paths.

The v0.2.9 rename covered `HANDOVER.md → torii-continuum-handoff.md`. This slice finishes the migration so all four Space-scoped source-of-truth files are named consistently.

Doc-only change. `npm run build` clean, unchanged bundle.

## v0.2.11-alpha — refresh `torii-continuum-handoff.md`

Handoff drifted through v0.2.7 → v0.2.10 without a substantive edit. Refreshed:

- Version header v0.2.9 → v0.2.11 + new "Active focus" paragraph.
- "Recent commits" block rewritten to cover the v0.2.1 → v0.2.10 arc.
- "Space context" section rewritten to reference the four Space-scoped source-of-truth files instead of Quest artifacts (`NOSTR_ARENA_MASTER_TODO.md`, `Strategy-&-Next-Steps.md`) that had leaked in — a standing-rule-#1 (never cross-name) violation hiding in the onboarding doc.
- "Next likely tasks" rewritten to reflect the post-agent / post-base-path / post-Ollama-fallback backlog rather than the v0.1.0-era items.
- Fixed a stale `v0.2.9-alpha` marker at `agent/README.md §10`.

Doc-only. Build clean, 57.63 kB main chunk unchanged.

## v0.2.10-alpha — scrub local-machine class mentions from docs

Docs contained references to specific local machine classes. Standing rule #4 forbids publishing device names, hostnames, or local machine identifiers to GitHub. Removed.

## v0.2.9-alpha — rename `HANDOVER.md` → `torii-continuum-handoff.md`

Matched the Space convention for source-of-truth files (`torii-continuum-{strategy,todo,progress,handoff}.md`).

## v0.2.8-alpha — cross-name audit

Cleaned up stale Torii Quest references that had leaked into Continuum docs during the pre-split period. Standing rule #1: each Torii app lives in a fully separate repo; files carry ONLY that repo's project name.

## v0.2.7-alpha — mirror standing operating rules into handoff

Codified the four standing rules (separate repos, bump every change, PR to main, no personal identifiers) plus the privacy-before-efficiency-before-80/20 priority hierarchy directly into the handoff so a resuming session sees them without having to reload memory.

## v0.2.6-alpha — CONT-INSTALLER-1 + CONT-AGENT-1b

- Base-path awareness in `vite.config.js` (`base: "./"`) so Continuum works both standalone at `continuum-torii.pplx.app` and mounted at `/continuum` by torii-base.
- Ollama fallback ladder in `agent/core/model-router.mjs` — strategies `routstr-first` (default), `ollama-first`, `ollama-only`, `routstr-only`. `provider` field on every return.

## v0.2.5-alpha — panic key: make kind 30097 explicitly optional

The panic-key event kind is optional and the client must not require it.

## v0.2.4-alpha — CONT-CHARACTER-1

Sealed character + memory infrastructure.

## v0.2.3-alpha — ornate Myōjin torii SVG

Custom SVG logo replacing the placeholder.

## v0.2.2-alpha — new H1 "The Gateway Project."

Landing page copy update.

## v0.2.1-alpha — dark default + security hardening

Made dark the canonical theme (never ship a light-default build). Session cookie `__Host-` prefix requirement documented.

## v0.2.0-alpha — CONT-AGENT-1 invariants + landing

First agent scaffold: `agent/` Fastify daemon, NIP-07 challenge/verify, HMAC-signed session tokens, Cashu wallet on VPS (`@cashu/cashu-ts` v2), Routstr chat client, first `chat` skill. Frontend integrations: landing page at `#/`, sidebar Login button, chat dock routes through `/api/chat` when signed in.

See `torii-continuum-v0.2.0-cont-agent-1-report.md` for the full slice narration.

## v0.1.0 (pre-split)

- Split planning: Continuum owns its own strategy and todo files (separate from Quest).
- Amber/gold torii favicon on warm bronze tile.
- Bronze/amber aesthetic to match continuum.pplx.app.
- Continuum app builder MVP.
