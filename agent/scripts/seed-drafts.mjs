/**
 * seed-drafts.mjs — write unsigned draft events into agent/pending/
 *
 * Runs once (idempotent — skips files that already exist). Emits drafts
 * for the initial character stack derived from CHARACTER.md + SOURCES.md.
 *
 * Nothing here signs, encrypts, or publishes. Every output is a
 * plaintext JSON file with `unsigned: true` and `content_plaintext`
 * set. The operator's signer (Plebeian Signer) converts each into a
 * real signed + NIP-44-encrypted event.
